          <p>
            Continuous assessment (CASS) is formally becoming an increasingly important part of the evaluation of South African students at matriculation level, with the weight attached to CASS in the final matriculation mark having been increased to 25%.
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
            More importantly, perhaps, CASS is the form in which students get feedback on their performance during the matriculation year, and such feedback is likely to have an important impact on their preparation and effort for the matriculation examination.Â 
          </p>Weak assessment in the school system could thus mean that students are getting the wrong signals. This may have important consequences for the way they approach the final examination. Moreover, if such wrong signals have also been common earlier in their school careers, it may also have had an important influence on their subject choice and career planning.
